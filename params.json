{"name":"justlazy.js","tagline":"lightweight javascript plugin for image lazy loading","body":"# justlazy.js [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/fhopeman/justlazy.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/fhopeman/justlazy)\r\nLightweight javascript plugin to lazy load (responsive) images. Most of the existing javascript plugins using jQuery or supporting just the img-tag. This plugin is supposed to be an alternative.\r\n\r\n- 100% performance with plain javascript (no jQuery)\r\n- 100% valid HTML (no empty src tag)\r\n- Simplicity and lightness (just lazy loading of images, no special cases)\r\n- Heavily tested on various devices, browsers and OS versions\r\n\r\n[![Sauce Test Status](https://saucelabs.com/browser-matrix/fhopeman.svg)](https://saucelabs.com/u/fhopeman)\r\n\r\n## Usage\r\nThe basic way is to include the justlazy.js file (maybe minified) into your page.\r\n\r\n### loading the img-tag\r\nThe images to lazy load are represented by a placeholder of your choice (e.g. div, span, ..). The `data-src` attribute is mandatory, the `data-alt` attribute optional. \r\n```\r\n  <span id=\"lazy-span\" data-src=\"path/to/image\" data-alt=\"altText\"></span>\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou can trigger the lazy loading with the following commands:\r\n```\r\n  var justlazy = Justlazy();\r\n  justlazy.lazyLoadImg(document.getElementById(\"lazy-span\"));\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe result will be:\r\n```\r\n  <img src=\"path/to/image\" alt=\"altText\"/>\r\n```\r\n\r\n### loading the picture-tag\r\nComing soon ..\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\njustlazy has CI set up through [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org) and [Sauce Labs](https://saucelabs.com) (free for open-source projects).\r\nPull-request and checkins will be tested automatically.\r\n\r\nTo run tests manually you can use the `grunt` command to perform jshint and jasmine tests with phantomjs.\r\nFurthermore you can run `grunt server` to call the jasmine runner in your browser [localhost:9999](http://localhost:9999)\r\n\r\n## Contributing\r\nJust feel free to contribute.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
